url URL date not supplied i just finished reading an article about mozilla NUMBER for salon com NUMBER this excerpt was rather amusing _it is a good question because in almost every way mozilla is a better browser than navigator for example netscape s best new feature tabbed browsing which lets you have several web pages open in the same browser window and allows you to bookmark all the pages under one name was in mozilla many months ago and the mozilla project that created it called multizilla already has an improved version available when asked about this yecies of netscape said that s true but the engineer who s working on it for mozilla is a netscape employee it was always done with the intention of fostering general browsing usability for netscape _ yes ok i suppose that s true if by netscape employee you really meant apple employee and by always done with the intention of fostering general browsing usability for netscape you meant was done in a weekend for mozilla because i thought multizilla was cool here s how the whole tabbed browsing thing happened one night i finally downloaded an extension called multizilla go check it out on mozdev org NUMBER i was particularly impressed with a feature contained in multizilla called tabbed browsing i started doing research and discovered netcaptor NUMBER a tabbed browser that embedded winie multizilla was cool but at the time suffered from two fundamental flaws that prevented the code from being incorporated into the mozilla tree the first was a ui flaw namely that at the time it had ripped off netcaptor down to the last context menu item the gui was similar enough that there would have been definite concerns about so obviously copying some of netcaptor s more obscure capabilities like sticky names and tab locking the second concern was that the tab behavior wasn t encapsulated cleanly into a widget i produced a simplified version of tabbed browsing on my own time did it in a weekend that removed some of the geekier netcaptor features and that encapsulated the tab behavior so that the changes to other navigator files would be minimal once i established that it didn t degrade performance in the single tab case i checked it in as an experiment the response was overwhelming as were the bugs that started being filed so much so that at first i wanted to back tabbed browsing out of the tree i was overruled by mozilla which turned out to be a good thing for all i think even with all the excitement and hoopla surrounding the advent of tabbed browsing on the engineering side and in the mozilla community netscape still didn t get it netscape marketing prioritized all sorts of useless work that nobody had even started above tabbed browsing in their marketing document they continued to do so for months simply not getting it it was this odd curiosity that one of their engineers had checked in and they didn t know what to make of it only after the press raved about it did netscape really jump on board i m sure netscape is doing the same thing now with popup blocking can t you just see it now we ll have a popup manager and a manager to manage the popup manager and twenty seven preferences for fine grained control of all aspects of popups can you believe how disfunctional netscape is when their engineers say you should do this or you should do that they get completely ignored or blown off but when cnet says we didn t like this or we didn t like that netscape scurries to meet their demands that is simply pathetic NUMBER URL NUMBER URL NUMBER URL NUMBER URL ,0

url URL date NUMBER NUMBER NUMBERtNUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER so i was researching the history of the tilde because d told me that her company just installed a new web proxy that denies access to any url with a tilde in it presumably because the presence of a tilde indicates with remarkable accuracy a personal site and apparently her employer believes that reading personal sites is not an appropriate use of company time which to be honest is probably accurate given the nature of her work but never mind that i don t want to talk about corporate politics i want to talk about the tilde every command line loving geek will tell you that stands for NUMBER home directory NUMBER and cd will take you to your home directory cd username will take you to someone else s except on mac os x where it will take you to their public file sharing directory it is from this heritage that we can trace the present day practice of using tildes in urls to denote personal pages since one single system wide configuration allowed individual users to have their own web sites by storing files in their own home directory or more commonly now that apache has taken over the world in their public_html subdirectory except on mac os x where if you turn on web sharing and point your browser to http localhost username you re actually being served files from that user s sites directory within their home directory but i don t want to talk about mac os x i want to talk about the tilde as with so many other things i find that jukka korpela NUMBER is the expert in this field jukka is no doubt a member of my karass NUMBER a word which google old habits die hard NUMBER feels is best explained by the personal site of eugene wallingford which like jukka s home page can not be referenced without a tilde in fact jukka has written a lengthy treatise on why the tilde should not be used in urls NUMBER a treatise which i feel obliged to point out contains a tilde in its url clearly the tilde is underappreciated digging further we find this post of jukka s from NUMBER NUMBER in which we learn that the tilde was not meant to be the tilde at all but rather an odd character called the overline presumably to balance out the underline if indeed those sorts of things require balance there is balance in the universe to be sure but i am less sure that it eminates from my keyboard no matter the tilde was the tilde so that spanish typing types could type the ntilde now referenced in html as the named entity ntilde but somewhere along the line it morphed into a general purpose character with all sorts of geeky uses digging even further it appears that the tilde was originally an alternate for NUMBER then an alternate for and its life as an overline replacement came even later jukka confirms this NUMBER and adds a timeline NUMBER for NUMBER for NUMBER for overline then june NUMBER NUMBER the watershed moment in an xNUMBER committee meeting when it was proposed NUMBER as exclusively a tilde in usa to appease share NUMBER i can find no further reference as to what this acronym means or what this committee meeting was about the next reference isn t until NUMBER when

groups NUMBER we find a reprint of a NUMBER william safire yes _that_ william safire article on language NUMBER in which we learn that is officially pronounced NUMBER squiggle NUMBER this is confirmed by the jargon dictionary NUMBER to this very day i m not sure this is useful but i just thought it was cool to see william safire writing about the proper pronunciation of various ascii characters as early as august NUMBER tilde was included in the waka waka bang splat poem NUMBER in july NUMBER kermit gained support for filenames containing a tilde NUMBER in february NUMBER an editor s note to an otherwise unrelated article notes that fidonet supported ascii characters space through tilde NUMBER as early as january NUMBER less used the tilde to denote lines past eof NUMBER as early as july NUMBER troff supported the tilde NUMBER in november NUMBER a mod sources post refers to bourne shell enhancements history tilde job control NUMBER as early as january NUMBER tilde was included on the

pronounced NUMBER tilde NUMBER NUMBER prompting this typographical pun NUMBER and that s the earliest reference i can find so where does that leave us unsatisfied no doubt there is history here but there are gaps what happened at that watershed meeting in NUMBER how did the tilde rise to prominence in the NUMBERs when did it become a synonym for NUMBER home directory NUMBER when did it migrate into the world of web servers to provide a cheap and simple way of giving individual users their own web sites i don t know and the lateness of the hour prevents me from continuing my research a

made half hearted attempts in this direction as i am forced to use windows during the day i say half hearted because i m still application centric and i don t go as far with keyboard shortcuts as i could but i don t use the desktop at all never have on any system and i don t use ctrl alt keyboard shortcuts because i personally find them awkward ymmv if you must use windows the first step towards a productive system is managing your start menu i use the main level of the start menu with numbered shortcuts to my most common programs NUMBER control panel NUMBER NUMBER mozilla NUMBER NUMBER emacs NUMBER NUMBER dos home NUMBER dos work NUMBER dos incoming each of which gives me a command line but in different directories NUMBER python NUMBER NUMBER ie also explorer home explorer work explorer incoming which open explorer windows in various useful directories the same directories as the dos shortcuts only with the shift key held down and yes i intentionally set it up so that went to my work

netscape NUMBER NUMBER paint shop pro query tool odbc NUMBER vmware NUMBER word NUMBER all other submenus except startup are removed from the programs menu yes delete accessories do you honestly ever use it if so it s probably a sign of a larger productivity problem things which never need to be run manually like winzip and quicktime are removed from the programs menu maintaining a clean programs menu is an ongoing struggle but well worth it on most modern keyboards there is a key next to your left alt key that opens the start menu which you can press with your left thumb without taking your fingers off the home keys otherwise ctrl esc always works menu NUMBER gives me a new command prompt in my work directory menu p n runs netscape NUMBER for compatibility testing in my day job ugh mozilla and emacs are almost always open but i quit lesser used applications as soon as i m done using them mostly because my laptop doesn t have a lot of memory i install cygwin NUMBER so that the command line is actually useful cygwin is a collection of windows ports of all your favorite unix utilities including mv cp scp ssh man tar less grep patch ncftp cvs and many others and bash which i don t use because i dislike how it handles windows pathnames i also set the properties of my command line shortcuts to set the window size to NUMBER x NUMBER almost full screen at NUMBER x NUMBER and screen buffer size to NUMBER x NUMBER set window position at NUMBER x NUMBER and don t let the system position the window in mozilla i set my home page to about blank set internet search to search with google use tabbed browsing open tabs instead of windows in all possible cases always show the tab bar and load links in the background essential for weblog surfing you can ctrl click links to open them in new tabs in the background under scripts plugins i do not allow scripts to open unrequested windows i turn off the sidebar turn on the site navigation bar delete all pre installed bookmarks and create two bookmarks one which takes me to my webmail and another which takes me to my internal site search NUMBER from which i can find all other bookmarks i need in internet explorer i set my home page to the page to edit my weblog since that s the only thing i do in internet explorer alt tab back and forth between mozilla and ie is easier than ctrl pgup pgdown between tabs within mozilla since textareas in mozilla lose focus when you switch tabs making copying and pasting weblog entries virtually impossible i use emacs locally and vi remotely because the default behavior of emacs is so heinous as to render it unusable for instance editing a cgi script named foo cgi on a web server with emacs would generate a foo cgi backup file which is world readable and is sent as plain text to any browser that asks try this sometime on your favorite web site among other things my emacs file which is actually called _emacs on windows instructs emacs to store all backup files in a single directory d backup to treat all xml files as docbook all cgi scripts as python and all sql scripts as pl sql to use cygwin s bash shell for m x shell to use a single maximized frame with no menubar titled as the name of the current file to show column numbers to accept y and n for yes no questions not to blink not to beep and to close the current file when i press m w i use some weird registry hacks and a hacked notepad exe to get all text files to open in emacs i got this idea from ultraedit NUMBER my _emacs file is my second most backed up possession i don t use windows useless

description and making title optional opened up rss to a whole new category of producer the weblogger allowing encoded html in description let publishers reuse both their existing content and the existing rss infrastructure without requiring them to produce valid xhtml which could be embedded directly into an xml document social mores rather than technical rules prevent producers from intentionally introducing security risks through malicious script tags or unpredictable display through unclosed html elements few publishing tools can produce real conforming guids and it doesn t matter because virtually all rss parsers are written in high level languages where handling strings is more efficient than converting strings to bytecodes and handling bytecodes as for dates by convention an rss document is laid out in reverse chronological order and no one seems to be clamoring for more flexibility furthermore its almost babyish xml syntax so far from any serious computational framework where are the namespaces where is the document type description why is the aggregators enforcement of conformity so lax made it possible for anyone wanting an rss feed to write one the effects of this ease of implementation only become clear when you compare it to the attempts over the years to NUMBER do rss right NUMBER NUMBER most notably rss NUMBER NUMBER in the year NUMBER rss NUMBER NUMBER had three main benefits backward compatible with rss NUMBER NUMBER which was never widely deployed and which fell into obscurity as soon as the much simpler rss NUMBER NUMBER was introduced based on rdf specifically a serialization called rdf xml a spec which at the time and to this day continues to change or threaten to change two years later there are no major languages or development platforms that ship with parsers to consume rdf although many perl python net have third party rdf parsers in various states of development and conformance the release version is generally out of date cvs access is recommended you get the idea meanwhile rdf xml production tools are so inconsistent that even rdf experts recommend not using rdf tools to produce an rss NUMBER NUMBER feed if you want it to actually be read by any major rss aggregator despite the two year old promise of better tools NUMBER it is now the year NUMBER and i built my rss NUMBER NUMBER feed NUMBER in the most sophisticated personal publishing system in the world NUMBER by manually typing a mishmash of template tags and angle brackets into a textarea of an html form extensible through namespaces which as mentioned above have been haphazardly and poorly incorporated into rss NUMBER NUMBER where they appear to be flourishing evolvable formats NUMBER those that proceed by being adapted and extended in a thousand small ways NUMBER have three main characteristics that are germane to their eventual victories over strong centrally designed formats only solutions that produce partial results with imperfect tools can succeed my rss feed is an xml document produced by a template that i built in a textarea and consumed by hundreds of parsers around the world that know nothing of xml and hack apart my feed with regular expressions the world is littered with formats that would have worked if only everyone had better tools if everyone in the world had a perfect rdf parser at their disposal it would be trivial to produce and consume all the world s metadata in rdf without such perfect tools both production and consumption instantly become nightmares there is no middle ground what is is wrong because evolvable formats have always been adapted to earlier conditions and are always being further adapted to present conditions they are always behind the times rss was being stretched with long descriptions optional titles and entity encoded html even before such practices were codified in the spec and long before all consumers could handle them no evolving format is ever perfectly in sync with the challenges it faces finally orgel s rule named for the evolutionary biologist leslie orgel NUMBER NUMBER evolution is cleverer than you are NUMBER as with the list of rss s obvious deficiencies above it is easy to point out what is wrong with any evolvable system at any point in its life no one seeing rss NUMBER NUMBER and rss NUMBER NUMBER side by side could doubt that rss NUMBER NUMBER had the superior technology that it NUMBER did things right NUMBER however the ability to understand what is missing at any given moment does not mean that one person or a small central group can design a better system in the long haul designed formats start out strong and improve logarithmically evolvable formats start out weak and improve exponentially rss NUMBER NUMBER is not the perfect syndication format just the best one that s also currently practical infrastructure built on evolvable formats will always be partially incomplete partially wrong and ultimately better designed than its competition NUMBER URL NUMBER URL ,0

url URL date not supplied feedback from my posting NUMBER about fogbugz NUMBER setup fell into four categories why make setup reversable instead you should collect all the information from the user and make all the changes in one batch at the end there are a couple of things to understand here first of all even if you do everything in one batch at the end there s always a possibility that some step in the middle of the batch will fail and in that case a well behaved setup program will back out the steps that were already done there are well over NUMBER error messages in the string table for fogbugz setup so the number of things that can fail is not insignificant second it s not nice to tell people about an error in their input three pages after they made the mistake for example early in the fogbugz setup process we prompt you to create an account for fogbugz to use img URL fogbugz setup screenshot the account creation could fail for a myriad of reasons none of which can be predicted before trying to create the account for example the password might not conform to the system password policy and different national versions of windows nt have different rules about accented letters in passwords betcha didn t know that it s better to tell the user about this problem right away so they can correct their input rather than having a message come up during the long install process later forcing the user to back up and fix it and even if you force the user to back up and fix it you still have to undo the first part of the work that you did before creating the account otherwise you ve left their system in an indeterminate state in any case i need to write code to create the account and delete the account in case something later fails i might as well call that code on this page of the wizard where i can display a useful error message and what are the kinds of things that need to be reversable well in order to upgrade fogbugz without requiring a reboot and we _never ever _require a reboot we have to shut down a couple of processes that might have been keeping fogbugz files pinned down such as iis microsoft s web server so part one of the batch is stop iis now if part NUMBER fails for some reason it would be _extremely_ rude to leave iis not running and anyway it s not like i don t need to write the code for start iis for the end of the batch so the code to rollback stop iis is already written no big deal i just need to call it at the right place i think one reason that people think you should gather all the info and then do all the work is because with very large installation programs that are very slow this is a polite way to waste less of the user s time indeed even fogbugz setup does NUMBER of its work at the very end but the create account operation is so fast that principle simply doesn t apply here even our NUMBER of the work phase takes well under a minute most of which is spent waiting for iis to stop and start why did you use vc mfc surely an advanced intelligence such as yourself has admitted by now that delphi NUMBER is more productive first of all leave your language religious fanaticism at the usenet door somehow i managed to figure out_ in high school_ that language advocacy and religious arguments are unbelievably boring secondly even if delphi were more productive the only pertinent question since i am writing the code is _what is more productive for joel spolsky_ and i don t know delphi at all but i know winNUMBER mfc and vc _really really well_ so while i might not outcode a good delphi programmer i would definitely outcode a completely inexperienced delphi programmer which is me certainly over a short NUMBER week project third many of the things i needed to do in this setup program are things like grant the logon as service privilege to an account this is rare enough that the only way to find out how to do this is to search the microsoft knowlege base and the web in general when you search the web in general for how to do fancy things with windows nt what you find is about NUMBER c code maybe NUMBER vb code and NUMBER everything else yes i know i could translate the c code into delphi assuming i was a sophisticated delphi programmer not a completely inexperienced delphi programmer but that costs as much productivity as i would supposedly gain from your supposedly more productive programming language and fourth i already had about NUMBER of the code i needed for setup in mfc format from fogbugz NUMBER NUMBER setup and a library i ve been using for years to make wizards why make setup at all you already have your customers money good setup programs don t increase sales this was actually the smartest question and made me think the hardest i came up with three reasons decreased tech support cost this setup program will pay for itself over the life of the code delight my customers when i m trying to get them to upgrade to NUMBER NUMBER i want them to remember how painless the NUMBER NUMBER installation was so they won t hesitate because they are afraid to upgrade i m still using an old version of spamassassin that is becoming increasingly ineffective even though i know the new version is much better because i just can t bear the thought of another morning wasted the very memory of the first spamassassin installation all the little ssh windows some su ed trying to scroll through man pages and google groups accidentally hitting ctrl z in emacs to undo and having it suspend trying to guess why we can t get the mta to run procmail sorry it s too much if spamassassin was making money off of upgraders they would have lost my business because they don t have a setup program win reviews software reviewers always cast about for some kind of standardized way to rate software even when they are comparing apples and oranges and planets and NUMBERth century philosophers they always have a meaningless list of things to review which can be applied to pc games mainframe databases web site auction software and dna sequencing software and setup is always on their list a single flaw in setup is guaranteed to be mentioned in every review

home lisa pierce has ground beef and roasts frozen vegetables and french fries even a couple of popsicles what she doesn t have is the meat of the moose she hit and killed with her car on nov NUMBER the moose that was rightfully hers but instead went to a neighbor the lack of it has her embroiled in a fight with the york county sheriff s department to get back what she says she is owed i think the deputy thought he was doing me a favor said pierce i m a woman and he just neglected to think that i would want it the moose is gone i know that now i want to be compensated for the meat whether or not that happens is uncertain her experience though highlights a law some mainers may not be aware of but should get to know during this peak time of deer versus car accidents as the animals in their mating season come out of the woods the law is simple a big game carcass caught by a car be it a moose deer or bear goes to the person who hits it as long as a law enforcement officer is called to the scene and the vehicle is damaged in the accident it comes up quite often in maine say officials last year there were NUMBER NUMBER cases of vehicles and deer colliding on maine roads and NUMBER accidents involving moose according to mark latti spokesman for the maine warden service in a state of what NUMBER NUMBER million with only NUMBER NUMBER licensed hunters i don t know how many motor vehicle drivers would know how to dress out a moose said latti you do have the option of keeping it which for some people can be valuable compensation for a damaged car farm grown deer meat can retail for NUMBER to NUMBER per pound in stores and a butchered or dressed moose which can t be bought or sold anywhere in maine can produce hundreds of pounds of food latti said when it comes to moose the law has been abused since its inception in NUMBER every now and then an officer will issue a summons to a driver for intentionally killing a moose with a car that kind of hunting makes no sense to latti hitting a moose even at a slow speed is no laughing matter large adult moose can weigh up to NUMBER NUMBER pounds and can be more than NUMBER feet tall since the bulk of their weight is above the hood level of most cars their bodies often come crashing through windshields in collisions more often than not crashes like these damage the vehicle the people inside and the animal sometimes they are fatal in NUMBER latti said there were six moose related fatalities after that when the number of moose hunting permits went from NUMBER NUMBER to NUMBER NUMBER there were less maine had three moose related fatalities in NUMBER one in NUMBER and two this year so far said stephen mccausland spokesman for the maine public safety department pierce considers herself lucky that she and the three children in her car did not become part of that statistic early on election day but she also feels cheated by the whole situation after all her car was totaled on the morning of the accident pierce was taking her two children and a neighbor s son to school in her NUMBER dodge dynasty she said she was going along at about NUMBER mph on a well traveled road when a moose came out of nowhere by the time my brain could see moose he was part of my windshield she said pierce is well aware of the law so as she sat in the ambulance with the children being treated for cuts and bruises she thought about the moose but the four of them were transferred to the hospital before she could deal with it so she said she wasn t able to follow up on the animal until later that day when she inquired she was told the deputy on the scene gave the fully racked bull moose to a neighbor who showed up with a tractor her neighbor she said subsequently offered her the moose for the NUMBER it took him to carry it away money she didn t think she should spend by the time she contacted the attorney general s office on nov NUMBER to complain about the deputy giving her moose away the neighbor s price had gone up another NUMBER for the cost of butchering NUMBER pounds of meat and when she called york county chief deputy maurice ouellette to complain that she should be compensated for the moose because it was the officer s fault that she didn t have it ouellette told her he could not give her cash and the best he could do was to give her the next moose struck in york county at that point in time it became an issue of not wanting moose anymore but wanting money ouellette said that conversation and a similar one she had with york county sheriff phil cote left pierce enraged and she now feels the issue has gone beyond the moose but the circumstances that brought her to this point are not surprising to other officials it s the officer s discretion said latti and if the officer feels the person can t immediately remove the animal he s got to think of public safety and other people on the roadway if someone is worried about her children in her car the last thing a law enforcement officer wants to ask is if she wants the moose maine state police trooper jeremy forbes said when he arrives at accidents that involve a serious injury to a person the issue of who gets the animal deer or moose becomes secondary the priorities are the injuries and getting people to the hospital he said if they are really hurt and going to the hospital the animal can t wait so we ll probably give it to the next person who stops by this is not comforting to pierce she said the deputy could have come to the ambulance and asked her what she wanted to do with the moose with her boyfriend a hunter nearby she could have easily taken care of the animal herself she knows her situation is probably a lost cause but she hopes other people especially other women do not have the same experience what about

carbonchio in italian he says he can also tell which countries took their recent elections seriously brazil and germany because of the frenzy of searches he notes that the globalisation of consumer culture means that the most popular brands are far flung in origin nokia sony bmw ferrari ikea and microsoft judging from google s data some sports events stir interest almost everywhere the tour de france wimbledon the melbourne cup horse race and the world series were among the top NUMBER sports related searches last year it also becomes obvious just how familiar american movies music and celebrities are to searchers across the globe two years ago a google engineer named lucas pereira noticed that searches for britney spears had declined indicating what he thought must be a decline in her popularity from that observation grew google zeitgeist a listing of the top gaining and declining queries of each week and month glancing over google zeitgeist is like taking a trivia test in cultural literacy ulrika jonsson the swedish born british television host and girlfriend of england football coach sven goran eriksson made the list recently so did irish travellers a nomadic ethnic group one of whose members was videotaped beating her young daughter in indiana and fentanyl the narcotic gas used in the moscow raid to rescue hostages taken by chechen rebels in late october the long lasting volume of searches involving her name has made britney spears something of a benchmark for the logs team it has helped them understand how news can cause spikes in searches as it did when she broke up with justin timberlake google can feel the reverberations of such events and others of a more serious nature immediately on feb NUMBER NUMBER for example an earthquake began near seattle at NUMBER NUMBER am local time within two minutes earthquake related searches jumped to NUMBER a minute from almost none with a concentration in the us pacific northwest on sept NUMBER searches for the world trade center pentagon and cnn shot up immediately after the attacks over the next few days nostradamus became the top search query fuelled by a rumour that nostradamus had predicted the trade center s destruction but the most trivial events may also register on google s sensitive cultural seismic meter the logs team came to work one morning to find that carol brady maiden name had surged to the top of the charts curious they mapped the searches by time of day and found that they were neatly grouped in five spikes each one starting at NUMBER minutes after the hour as the logs were passed through the office employees were perplexed why would there be a surge in interest in a character from the NUMBERs sitcom the brady bunch but the data could only reflect patterns not explain them that is a paradox of a google log it does not capture social phenomena per se but merely the shadows they cast across the internet the most interesting part is why said amit patel who has been a member of the logs team you can t interpret it unless you know what else is going on in the world so what had gone on on april NUMBER NUMBER that night the million dollar question on the game show who wants to be a millionaire had been what was carol brady s maiden name seconds after the show s host posed the question thousands flocked to google to search for the answer tyler producing four spikes as the show was broadcast successively in each us time zone the precision of the carol brady data was eye opening for some it was like trying an electron microscope for the first time said sergey brin who as a graduate student in computer science at stanford helped found google in NUMBER and is now its president for technology it was like a moment by moment barometer predictably google s query data respond to television movies and radio but the mass media also feed off the demands of their audiences one of google s strengths is its predictive power flagging trends before they hit the radar of other media as such it could be of tremendous value to entertainment companies or retailers google is quiet about what if any plans it has for commercialising its vast store of query information there is tremendous opportunity with this data mr silverstein said the challenge is defining what we want to do google currently does not allow outsiders to gain access to raw data because of privacy concerns searches are logged by time of day originating ip address information that can be used to link searches to a specific computer and the sites on which the user clicked people tell things to search engines that they would never talk about publicly _ viagra pregnancy scares fraud facelifts what is interesting in the aggregate can be seem an invasion of privacy if narrowed to an individual in aggregate form google s data can make a stunning presentation next to mr rae s cubicle is the geodisplay a NUMBER inch screen that gives a three dimensional geographical representation of where google is being used around the globe the searches are represented by coloured dots shooting into the atmosphere the colours _ red yellow orange _ convey the impression of a globe whose major cities are on fire the tallest flames are in new york tokyo and the san francisco bay area each country has a distinctive usage pattern spain france and italy have a midday lull in google searches presumably reflecting leisurely lunches and relaxation in japan the peak usage is after midnight when phone rates for dial up modems drop google s worldwide scope means that the company can track ideas and phenomena as they hop from country to country take las ketchup a trio of singing sisters who became a sensation in spain last spring with a gibberish song and accompanying knee knocking dance similar to the macarena like a series of waves google searches for las ketchup undulated through europe over the summer and fall the ketchup song hey hah has already topped the charts in NUMBER

one of the main strands of this modernisation is to have all stations on a retained basis at night basically this means that the fire station will be unmanned and in the event of a fire the fire fighters will be summonsed by pagers the same way that they currently are in a lot of rural regions the main reason for this is that fewer fires occur at night however the majority of fatalities in fires do occur at night and the recent deaths during the fire fighters strike all occurred at night over half of these happened in areas currently covered by retained crews who aren t on strike and would appear to give a grim foreshadowing of what may be to come currently one of the conditions for being in a retained crew is that you must live work within one mile of the station how they will apply this to whole time fire fighters is still unclear a good friend of mine is a station officer in hampshire and currently lives NUMBER miles from his station so how he ll respond to fire calls at night is a mystery and i can t see many fire fighters living within a mile of some of the inner london stations dave to unsubscribe from this group send an email to forteana unsubscribe URL your use of yahoo groups is subject to URL ,0

the times december NUMBER NUMBER university boom creates era of sexual tolerance by helen rumbelow the boom in university education has led to a sea change in britain s tolerance of homosexuality according to a report just under half the people now believe that homosexuality is always or mostly wrong down from three quarters NUMBER years ago according to the british social attitudes survey regarded as one of the best indicators of popular opinion that trend is mirrored by the attitude towards ethnic minorities with NUMBER per cent of people now saying they are not at all racially prejudiced compared with NUMBER per cent in NUMBER geoffrey evans a politics professor at oxford university decided to focus on what has caused britain to become more open minded in a report published today the study from the national centre for social research is based on interviews with a cross section of NUMBER NUMBER people young people are much more tolerant than their elders with a quarter of twentysomethings believing that homosexual sex is always wrong compared with two thirds of pensioners but the key to converting a bigot is to send him or her to college with graduates twice as accepting of homosexuals as those with no gcses and a third less racist that transformation happened no matter what social class the student came from and with NUMBER per cent of young people now attending university it was a powerful social effect professor evans said mr blair s famous mantra education education education seems far less consequential now than when first announced in NUMBER as britain struggles with an overburdened health service and the reality that as more and more people get degrees degrees buy less and less he said but the growth of higher education can provide a bulwark against the undermining of liberal democracy through intolerance he added he decided to see whether the tolerance conferred by schooling was just political correctness by testing how many civil rights the educated would give to an unattractive minority white supremacists again people scored higher the longer they had spent at school and university with nearly two thirds of graduates saying that white supremacists should have the right to give television interviews or stand in elections three times as many as those with no qualifications it is not clear why those with higher education are more tolerant the report says adding that it may be simply because university students have increased contact with alternative points of view professor evans also looked at whether the young may grow out of their idealism but found the opposite to be true thirtysomethings were more than twice as likely to say there was nothing wrong with homosexuality as they were when they were in their early twenties he said that as these groups of more educated young people replaced the older generation britain would become an ever more relaxed place soft drugs have also grown in widespread acceptability with more than half the country wanting cannabis to be legalised compared with a third seven years ago that is probably because the use of cannabis is now so widespread with a quarter of those surveyed saying that they had tried it a third of labour voters twice as many as conservatives had tried the drug and being young living in london and having a degree also increased the chances one issue that bucks the trend is hard drugs most take a strong position on heroin that has got stronger over the past seven years now the proportion of people who believe that heroin dealers should always be prosecuted has crept up to NUMBER per cent the views on heroin show that britain is by no means becoming a liberal free for all alison park co director of the study said people are making quite a clear distinction between what they think of as right and wrong on other matters the survey indicates that almost half those questioned think that most of the social security budget goes on unemployment benefits in fact they account for NUMBER per cent that union membership has fallen by a fifth in the past NUMBER years with just under a third of workers in a union and that half those questioned oppose secondary school selection in NUMBER the figure was NUMBER per cent the survey also indicates that NUMBER per cent of men aged between NUMBER and NUMBER live with their parents twice as many as women to unsubscribe from this group send an email to forteana unsubscribe URL your use of yahoo groups is subject to URL ,0
