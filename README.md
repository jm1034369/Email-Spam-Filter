# Email-Spam-Filter
For our prediction method, we used the nearest neighbor method since that gave us the most success, and for our distance calculation we used the euclidean distance formula. We also tried using the summary of the features to run our test against, but the accuracy was not as good. We narrowed down the following features: word frequency, n-gram frequency, url count, and special character word count, since those best determine whether and email is spam or not. The runtime for the test dataset with the nearest neighbor method is 45 min, and has 96.4169% accuracy. All of the datasets we used (spam_training.csv, ham_training.csv, and ham_and_spam_test.csv are all in the project folder). All you have to do is run main. It will take 45 min, and will output each prediction to the console as it runs as well as print it to Predictions.csv
